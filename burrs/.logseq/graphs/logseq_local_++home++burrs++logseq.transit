tempted to call this gg2 but refrained.\n- I really [[think]] that we have something nice going.\n- but with all good things, they must meet a bittersweet end.\n- I hope that I can send this to you once we're drifted apart.\n- I [[think]] that all friends are temporary, what makes friends is not anything to do with how well you click, but I believe more so proximity.\n- I believe that when it comes to relationships, quantity trumps quality in every single way.\n- don't get me wrong you can have interactions so bad they're negative.\n- but remember the opposite of love, and friendship isn't

What is dark matter?\nCurrently there is an open problem with our theory of the galaxy, and pretty much the universe.\nThe problem exists in the fact that gravity in our universe acts strangely. Gravity at the super massive scale has been observed to act at much higher levels.\nThe problems of which lead us to two conclusions.\nIt’s either our theory of gravity at extreme macro scales is wrong,\nor there exists a new type of particle or particles, one that doesn’t exist inside the current standard model.\nTake a look at the current standard particle model.\nDark matter, as theorized has these four traits,\ninteracts gravitationally\nis electrically neutral and does not interact with the strong force\nlargely non-relativistic (“cold”)\nStable on cosmological timescales\nBasically what this means is that the matter observed in the universe cannot be made up of any of the particles in our current standard model.\nAnd dark matter makes up 5 times the amount of normal matter in the universe, despite this vast number, if you were to take all the mass of dark matter on earth and condense it down to a single object, it'd be around the size of a squirrel.\nAll of these traits are the reason why there have been no confirmed interactions of dark matter here on earth. All except one controversial result up north.\n- ### DAMA/LIBRA\n  This all started with an experiment in Italy, designed from the ground up to detect a dark matter particle called a WIMP.\n  A WIMP is just a \"weakly interacting massive particle\". Its name could not be more straightforward; it’s a large particle, that interacts with the weak force.\n  Now I find this misleading; this experiment is more so not to see if dark matter consists of WIMPs, but to attempt to prove or disprove the existence of dark matter that is WIMP-like, in conjunction with proving it exists.\n  It's exactly this weak force interaction that DAMA/LIBRA is testing for. And its the reason DAMA/LIBRA exists.\n  Lets back up a bit into the weak force interaction.\n- ### Z boson <- insert [[Physics]] game nostalgia bait\n  Some of the talented people working at ANU have devised an online playable board game called 'particle builder'\n  In the game it is specified that the weak force, or in this specific case of SABRE the Z boson can interact with all leptons and quarks particles in the standard model. The Z boson card is as far as I know the best card in the game, due to its versatility with most particles in the standard model.\n  Link back to what is theorized/concrete about dark matter if it were to exist. We have only two avenues of attack for detection. Gravity, and potentially the weak force. Gravity is so unimaginably weak compared to all [[other]] forces that our current measurement devices cannot feasibly pick up the signal. In fact its so weak that potentially non-negligible uncertainty comes into play. So the weak force is what we're left with.\n  But here's the kicker, its uncertain if dark matter even interacts with the weak force, let alone [[other]] factors.\n  DAMA/LIBRA is practically a stab in the dark.\n  And its exactly this reason why DAMA/LIBRA's results are such a big topic in dark matter.\n- ###  Results? what results?\n  Dark matter just exists in space, kind of like air. \n  imagine the air around us, its mostly unmoving, you move through the air slower or faster, the amount you are interacting or moving the air changes respective to your velocity.\n  You move in terms of the earths reference frame, but the air around you doesn't (mostly).\n  Similarly, earth relative to everything in the galactic reference frame of the milky way, has a modulating velocity.\n  Dark matter does not, dark matter moves relative to the milky way.\n  Take a look at this fantastic visual made by Veritasium showcasing what this modulation looks like.\n  Basically what this means, is that at some points of the yearly cycle, the amount of coincident dark matter interactions the earth would experience would theoretically be higher or lower. And this is what DAMA/LIBRA's results show, a modulation in weak particle interactions, which WIMP's can and should cause.\n  There is irrefutable modulation in DAMA/LIBRA's results, multiple multiple sigma's of certainty in fact, and the theory in contention is that the cause of this modulation is due to dark matter interacting less or more with particles in earth.\n  The contention of these results comes from the couple of notable reproduction attempts of DAMA/LIBRA, the main two being ANAIS 112 and COSINE 100. They both have opposing results to the dama libra, having little to no dark matter oscillation.\n  This is where SABRE comes in.\n- ### The Need For SABRE\n  SABRE, otherwise known as “Sodium Iodide with Active Background Rejection Experiment,” is just a reconstructed DAMA/LIBRA experiment built on the [[other]] side of the world. \n  This experiment is designed practically in every way to be better than DAMA/LIBRA. It will likely be the last experiment disproving/proving the validity of DAMA/LIBRA's results.\n  As SABRE is on the [[other]] side of the hemisphere, if seasonal shifts (which is the main counterargument against the results of damalibra) in earth was the main cause of DAMA/LIBRA's results, then theoretically SABRE's results would flip.\n  This experiment, quite smartly is split into two parts, SABRE North, and SABRE South. Italy being in the northern hemisphere and Australia being in the southern hemisphere.\n- ### What is SABRE south\n  Going back to the name:\n  “Sodium Iodide with Active Background Rejection Experiment”. \n  Split it up into two different parts, the Sodium Iodide, and the Active Background Rejection.\n  In particular, Thallium doped Sodium Iodide is what is used in this experiment.\n- #### Sodium iodide\n  A scintillator is a material that absorbs energy, and emits a light with energy relative to that absorbed force.\n  The theory is that, as the earth moves slower or faster through dark matter, these scintillators come into contact with a modulating amount of dark matter WIMPs.\n  When they come into contact, the WIMPs interact with the scintillator via the weak force, and emit light, with energy relative to the WIMP's energy\n  This is the basis of the experiment, and maintaining top quality assurance for the Sodium iodide is a high priority in this experiment.\n- #### Scintillator purity\n  The crystals are grown extremely carefully to eliminate radioactive impurities.\n  According to these sources, the crystals would theoretically have the lowest in crystal interference ever used in the a direct dark matter detection experiment globally. see sabre technical design report\n  Don't [[think]] this attention to detail isn't worth the effort. Maintaining high purity Scintillators is important, in particular the 210Pb, Tritium and 87Rb are the biggest elements to take caution to, as these all decay significantly enough to warrant the attention to detail.\n  This is an image of how many different elements were considered for this experiment.\n- #### Detector system\n  These flashes of visible light then get absorbed by photomultiplier tubes (PMT's), which are recorded and then used in the data.\n  PMT's are just tubes which take a frequency of electromagnetic photons and multiply and record the signal.  \n  PMT's are 'coupled' to the Sodium Iodide, they are coupled in the creation phase of the scintillator. so when the crystal is made.\n  The PMT's feed into a digitizer, which transforms the information into [[Computer]] readable bits.\n- #### [[Computer]] analysing system https://indico.cern.ch/event/1106992/papers/4991330/files/11669-ACAT22_proceedings.pdf\n  The framework they're using for their computers 'PyRate v2' was specifically designed and made for this experiment.\n  The analysis system goes a bit like this:\n  Start with a run object, which instantiates all of the main objects. (these run objects are instantiated using the job object, when multiple run objects are necessary)\n  When an event happens, aka when a 'Wimp' interacts with the Sodium Iodide, the reader interprets the Data implemented from the algorithm. And then proceeds to store it inside the 'STORE' object.\n  The writer outputs the data onto an output file in the form of a python dictionary, so basically a json file. This file is likely interpreted with more data interpretation software, any of which would likely be viable for use in this experiment.\n  There are two objects in this framework which are changed for the use in SABRE.\n  These being Algorithm and Input. AKA Algorithm: how the events/weak interaction detections are interpreted and Input: how they're received.\n- #### Background rejection -> deep underground\n  The main catalyst for error in this experiment is cosmic radiation muons.\n  To combat this, Both SABRE experiments have two shields.\n  The first and most important one is that they're both located deep underground.\n  The SUPL, aka the Stalwell Underground [[Physics]] Laboratory is 2.87 km underground, this is where SABRE South is located. That is 2.87 kilometres of straight rock.\n  As you go further and further down, the muon amount decreases exponentially.\n  In addition to the large natural earth shielding from being deep underground, the entire thing is shielded with walls that are 16 centimetres of steel thick and 10 centimetres of HDPE(High density polyethylene). All in all 112 tonnes of steel. This also prevents radon from underground ore in addition to the cosmic muons. In addition to this, SUPL has painted the walls with radon prevention paint. Remember that all quarks and leptons interact weakly, so anything basically can interfere with the results from the experiments.\n- #### Active veto system\n  In addition to the fact that practically every interference particle is blocked much before even being able to interact weakly with the scintillator, SABRE has two vetoes.\n  Vetoes are [[other]] sensors that are in place to detect if non dark matter based interactions inside the scintillator had occured, and vetoes those interactions from the results.\n  These two vetos that SABRE South has are the liquid scintillator housing and the plastic scintillator muon veto system.\n  The plastic scintillator muon veto system is filled with 8 EJ-200 solid plastic scintillator modules.\n  These scintillator modules are then fitted with 2 different sized but same designed PMT's as what is coupled to the Sodium Iodide for the experiment.\n  if there were to be a muon from the sky that does interact with the Sodium Iodide scintillator, the plastic would emit light, which the pmt's inside the modules would record, and the event would be \"vetoed\" from the experiment. \n  The second veto inside SABRE South is the liquid scintillator housing.\n  SABRE South's Sodium Iodide apparatus, or the crystal in [[other]] words is covered completely in a liquid scintillator housing, so as to detect any highly angular muons that may interact with the crystal.\n  If the first roof veto doesn't detect the muon, the second liquid scintillator muon will instead.\n- #### SABRE south and north differences -> good question for the [[test]].\n  They only have one difference, and this difference is in the veto system. SABRE North's underground laboratory has completely phased out organic scintillators, meaning there is no liquid scintillator veto shielding.\n  There is still one roof Scintillator veto and the fact that radon interference doesn't modulate makes the non-use of liquid Scintillator largely negligible.\n  SABRE South is the much more important experiment anyway, Meaning north can be somewhat ignored either way\n  SABRE South has opted for the use of a large liquid scintillator due to SUPL needing to [[test]] for interference anyway. This will be the first experiment in the laboratory after all, why not kill two birds with one stone and use the massive scintillator to validate the SUPL's background radiation. It's likely in the future that organic scintillators will be phased out, but thankfully not for this experiment.\n- ### [[Other]] unmentioned pieces of note\n  Here are some [[other]] details of the experiment. Expect bad segues and flow.\n  For every step of this process heavy simulation and testing has gone underway. So much so that the expected results have already been calculated, so as too the detections that might not be vetoed such as the couple muons and few scintillator radioactive decays. \n  Considerable thought has been given as for the safety of this experiment, and most safety procedures will be handled by SUPL instead. One area of note, is that due to SABRE South incorporating organic liquid scintillator, more care has to be taken than in the north for safety purposes.\n  This is also why steel was opted for instead of lead for the shielding, even though lead is pretty much double effective.\n  Aside from the experiment, there are [[other]] unrelated sensors that are used, likely for SUPL purposes and safety reasons, these being Thermometers, Barometers, Hygrometers, Liquid level sensors for the liquid scintillators, Volatile organic compound sensors, Vibration accelerometers, Radon sensors, Oxygen sensors, Voltage sensors, and potential others that may be installed by the SUPL.\n  These sensors are important for recalibration of the crystals and vetos of the experiment.\n  SABRE is located deep underground, and transportation has been considered also for designs. Much of the building and creation process has been outsourced out of Melbourne, such as the high purity crystals being fabricated in Canberra, at the ANU.\n- ### What this means for now\n  Dark matter is such a big open problem in [[Physics]], its just fact that some people may very well wish to fake a couple results to have their place in history forever.\n  This experiment is the last bastion for the DAMA/LIBRA's dark matter direct detection theory.
